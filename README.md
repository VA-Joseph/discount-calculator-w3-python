# Week 3 Assignment - Discount Calculator

This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount, based on a user-defined discount percentage.

## Functionality

- Defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that:
  - Applies the discount if it's **20% or more**.
  - Returns the original price if the discount is **less than 20%**.
- Prompts the user to enter:
  - Original price of the item
  - Discount percentage
- Displays the final price or indicates no discount was applied.

## Example

```bash
Enter the original price of the item: 10000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied! The final price is: 7500.0
